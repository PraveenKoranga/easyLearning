NoSQL databases are used in real-time web applications and big data and their use are increasing over time. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize the fact that they may support SQL-like query languages.A NoSQL database includes simplicity of design, simpler horizontal scaling to clusters of machines and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases are different from those used by default in relational databases which makes some operations faster in NoSQL. The suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it should solve. Data structures used by NoSQL databases are sometimes also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables. Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency in favor of availability, speed and partition tolerance. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-level query languages, lack of standardized interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational databases. Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions but a few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB have made them central to their designs.",

Thirdly, easy creation of data mart, because for creating the data warehouse a lot of resources and work is to be done while the creation of data mart is far easy compared to the data warehouse. There is a minimal cost that is related to data mart. There are three types of data marts: dependent, independent, and hybrid. Dependent data marts are built by drawing data from the existing central warehouse. In contrast, independent data marts are created by drawing from operational or external data sources or both. Dependent data mart offers analytical capabilities for a restricted data warehouse area. Moreover, it also provides isolated security and solo performance. A hybrid data mart combines input from a data warehouse, operational systems and external systems. The difference lies in how the data is extracted from the source, how data has been transformed that needs to be applied, and how the data has been transported into the mart. Dependent Data Mart pulls data from the enterprise data warehouse, which has already been cleaned and transformed. Independent data mart has to carry out the cleansing and transformation of data as the data has been coming from the operational systems and external sources. Whatever the type, the main aim of the data mart is to provide data to the end-users that are most relevant to them when they need it.

It does not mean that a data lake is a place to dump your data without governance. While the data is appropriately classified in the data lake, it is protected and governed. Data lakes can be deployed using cloud object storage such as Amazon S3 or large scale distributed systems such as Apache Hadoop to process big data.

This is particularly important when the destination for the dataset is a relational database. This type of data repository has a defined schema which requires alignment—i.e. matching data columns and types—to update existing data with new data. As the name suggests, data pipelines act as the “piping” for data science projects or business intelligence dashboards. Data can be sourced through a wide variety of places—APIs, SQL and NoSQL databases, files, et cetera, but unfortunately, that data usually isn’t ready for immediate use. Data preparation tasks usually fall on the shoulders of data scientists or data engineers, who structure the data to meet the needs of the business use case. The type of data processing that a data pipeline requires is usually determined through a mix of exploratory data analysis and defined business requirements.

But a computer's CPU can't compute anything or produce output data without the user's input.  Users can enter the input data directly into a computer. However, they have found early on in the computer-era that continually entering data manually is time- and energy-prohibitive. One short-term solution is computer memory, also known as random access memory (RAM). But its storage capacity and memory retention are limited. Read-only memory (ROM) is, as the name suggests, the data can only be read but not necessarily edited. They control a computer's basic functionality. Although advances have been made in computer memory with dynamic RAM (DRAM) and synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), they are still limited by cost, space and memory retention. When a computer powers down, so does the RAM's ability to retain data. The solution? Data storage. With data storage space, users can save data onto a device. And should the computer power down, the data is retained. And instead of manually entering data into a computer, users can instruct the computer to pull data from storage devices. Computers can read input data from various sources as needed, and it can then create and save the output to the same sources or other storage locations. Users can also share data storage with others. Today, organizations and users require data storage to meet today's high-level computational needs like big data projects, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and the internet of things (IoT). And the other side of requiring huge data storage amounts is protecting against data loss due to disaster, failure or fraud. So, to avoid data loss, organizations can also employ data storage as backup solutions. ",

When you ingest data in batches, data is imported at regularly scheduled intervals.

Real-time ingestion is useful when the information gleaned is very time-sensitive, such as data from a power grid that must be monitored moment-to-moment.

                                para: "Quality can be defined as “fitness for use,” “customer satisfaction,” “doing things right the first time,” or “zero defects.” These definitions are acceptable because quality can refer to degrees of excellence. Webster's dictionary defines quality as “an inherent characteristic, property or attribute. Quality is a very important factor when it comes to any product or service. Competition between companies are increasing and quality has become the market differentiator for almost all products and services. Quality control is essential to building a successful business that delivers products that meet or exceed customers’ expectations. It also forms the basis of an efficient business that minimizes waste and operates at high levels of productivity. A quality control system based on a recognized standard, such as ISO 9001 published by the International Organization for Standardization, provides a strong foundation for achieving a wide range of marketing and operational benefits. When it comes to standards for quality, there are many. ISO (International Standards Organization) is one of the prominent bodies for defining quality standards for different industries. Therefore, many organizations try to adhere to the quality requirements of ISO. In addition to that, there are many other standards that are specific to various industries. Since standards have become a symbol for products and service quality, the customers are now keen on buying their product or the service from a certified manufacturer or a service provider. Therefore, complying with standards such as ISO has become a necessity when it comes to attracting the customers. As an ISO 9001:2015 certified company, Curvent International strives to deliver excellence and therefore have incorporated state of the art automated production lines, linked to the ISO quality management system.",

After completing the surveys and aggregating the data (along with competitive analysis when applicable), it’s boiled down into the Voice of the Customer. These customer requirements, requests, demands, and preferences are framed as specific items and ideally ranked in importance. These are then listed on the left-hand side of the House of Quality matrix and represent what customers want the product to do. From here, the technical requirements can be created, with each of them tying back to the Voice of the Customer items identified in the signature Quality Function Deployment matrix, the House of Quality. These Voice of the Customer items will continue to trickle down into other stages of product development and deployment, including component definition, process planning, and quality control. When the product is “done,” the Voice of Customer requirements initially identified in the process should be clearly met (or intentionally left out).

QFD is most appropriate when companies are focused on relatively iterative innovation versus something completely new since there is a large base of customer feedback and input to drive the process.
