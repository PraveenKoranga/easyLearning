              unit1: `The branch of science that deals with the interaction of components of matter, structure of matter, and interaction between fundamental constituents of the observable universe is known as Physics. Physics is taken from the Greek word 'physikos' which means the study of physical sciences, or Knowledge of Nature, and that's why in a broad sense, it can be said Physics is the study of science which is concerned with all aspects of nature and natural phenomenon on both sub microscopic and macroscopic level. What is Physics The study of physics not only encompasses how the object is behaving under the given forces, but its scope also includes the behavior of the object under the action of every force present in nature. Therefore, the study of physics also deals with the origin and effect of all types of forces present in nature, such as electromagnetic force, gravitational force, nuclear force fields, and many more, and how these forces act in a particular system or on a particular object. The ultimate objective of Physics is to formulate a few comprehensive principles that will together be effective enough to explain all natural phenomena of a kind. Other definitions of Physics states, 'It is the study of natural science that studies the related entities of force and energy, motion and behavior of an object through space and time, matter and its fundamental constituents.' In simple words, it can be said that physics is one of the most fundamental disciplines of science, and its ultimate goal is to understand how the universe works and behaves. Physics is one of the oldest disciplines of science (Perhaps the oldest one when astronomy is included). Before the scientific revolution of 17th science, physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and other branches of science were part of natural philosophy over the past two millennia. But, when the scientific revolution happened, all these branches from natural philosophy or natural science emerged as unique research endeavors in their own aspect. Talking about today's time, Physics intersects with many other disciplines of natural science and other streams and thus forms an interdisciplinary relation and area of research for physicists. Quantum chemistry, Biophysics, Thermodynamics, and many others are examples of interdisciplinary fields of physics that include areas of research from other branches of natural science. Even in today's time, almost three centuries after the scientific revolution of the 17th century, it is not possible to define the rigid boundaries of Physics and separate it from other natural science disciplines. Many new ideas are emerging in physics, which often explain the fundamentals of some phenomena studied under physics and fundamental mechanisms studied by other natural science disciplines. These new emerging ideas also suggest new avenues for the academic research of many disciplines such as philosophy, mathematics, and many others.`,

Thus the sign of Hall coefficient can be used to determine whether a given Semi-conductor is n or p-type.

It is denoted by 𝐸𝐹 .Drude and Lorentz proposed free electron theory of on the basis of some assumptions.  In conductors (metals), there are large number of free electrons moving freely within the metal i.e. the free electrons or valence electrons are free to move in the metal like gaseous molecules, because nuclei occupy only 15% metal space and the remaining 85% space is available for the electrons to move.  Since free electrons behave like gaseous molecules, the laws of kinetic theory of gases can be applied. The mean K.E of a free electron is equal to that of a gas molecule at same temperature.  In the absence of any electric field, the electrons move randomly while undergoing scattering at +ve ion centers. The collisions are regarded as elastic (no loss of energy).  The electron speeds are distributed according to the Maxwell- Boltzmann distribution law.  When an electric filed is applied, the free electrons are accelerated in a direction opposite to that of the field.  The free electrons are confined to the metal due to surface potential.  The electrostatic force of attraction between the + ve ion cores and the free electrons is assumed to be negligible.Heat capacities: - The internal energy of a molar substance, U = 3 2 KTN Molar specific heat 𝐶𝑣 = 𝜕𝑉 𝜕𝑇 = 3 2 𝐾𝑁 = 3 2 𝑅 ‘N’ is the Avogadro number, K is Boltzmann constant and R is the universal gas constant.

                " Electric dipole: Two equal and opposite charges small in magnitude and separated by a small distance constitute a electric dipole. Dipole moment: The product of magnitude of both charge and the distance between the two charges. i.e. µ = q r. It is a vector quantity. The direction of µ is from negative to positive. Dielectric constant:(𝜺𝒓): Dielectric constant is the ratio between the permittivity of the medium to the permittivity of the free space. 𝜺𝒓= 𝜺 𝜺𝒐 Since it is the ratio of same quantity, 𝜺𝒓 has no unit. Polarization: The process of producing electric dipoles which are oriented along the field direction is called polarization in dielectrics. Polarization vector (P): The dipole moment per unit volume of the dielectric material is called polarization vector P. 𝑃 = µ 𝑉 If µ is the average dipole moment per molecule and N is the number of molecules per unit volume, then polarization vector, 𝑃 = 𝑁µ = NαE Electric displacement vector is a quantity which is a very convenient function for analyzing the electrostatic field in the dielectrics and is given by D=𝜀𝑜E+P.Ferro Electricity: Substances exhibiting electronic polarization even in the absence of external field are called Ferroelectric Materials. This phenomenon is known as Ferroelectricity. Examples: Rochelle salt (NaKC4H4O6.4H2O), Lead Titanate, PbTiO3, Lead zirconate Titanate (PZT), Lead lanthanum zirconate Titanate (PLZT).Piezo Electricity: When certain crystals are subjected to stress, the electric charges appear on their surface with certain distance of separation. This is called the piezoelectric effect. The crystals exhibiting Piezo electric effect are called piezoelectric crystals and this phenomenon is called Piezo electricity. Examples: Quartz, Rochelle salt, Tourmaline.Magnetic flux(𝝋): The number of lines passing normally through an area. Its unit is Weber. Magnetic induction (or) Magnetic flux density (B): The magnetic induction in any material is the number of lines of magnetic force passing through unit area perpendicularly. Its unit is Weber/𝑚2or tesla. Magnetic field intensity (or) strength (H): Magnetic field intensity at any point in the magnetic field is the force experienced by a unit North Pole placed at that point. Its unit is ampere 𝑚−1 Magnetization (or) Intensity of magnetization (I): The term of magnetization is the process of converting a non magnetic material into a magnetic material. It is also defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume.I = M V . Its units is ampere 𝑚−1 Magnetic susceptibility (χ): The ratio of intensity of magnetization (I) produced to the magnetic field strength (H) in which the material is placed. 𝑥 = I H Magnetic permeability of medium (µ): It is defined as the ratio of magnetic induction B in a substance to the applied magnetic field intensity. µ = B H.Ferri magnetic substances are the materials in which the atomic or ionic dipoles in one direction are having unequal magnitudes. This alignment of dipole gives a net magnetization and those magnetic substances which have two or more different kind of atoms. These are also called Ferrites.Polarization: The process of producing electric dipoles which are oriented along the field direction is called polarization in dielectrics. Types of Polarizations: Polarization occurs due to several atomic mechanisms. When the specimen is placed inside electric field, mainly three types of polarizations are possible. Those are  Electronic polarization  Ionic polarization  Orientational or Dipolar polarization. Electronic polarization occurs due to the displacement of negatively charged electron in opposite direction.  When an external field is applied and there by creates a dipole moment in the dielectric.  Therefore induced dipole moment µ=𝛼𝑒E.  Where 𝛼𝑒 is the electronic polarizability.  Electronic polarizability is proportional to the volume of atoms.  This Polarization is independent of temperature.This is due to the displacement of cations and anions in opposite directions and occurs in an ionic solid. This type of polarization occurs in ionic dielectrics like Nacl.  When such a dielectric material is subjected to an external electric field, adjacent ions of opposite sign undergoes displacement and this displacement results either increase or decrease in the distance of separation between ions.  If x1 and x2 are the displacements of positive and negative ions in an ionic crystal due to the application of electric field E, then dipole moment𝜇 = 𝑞 × (𝑥1 + 𝑥2).`",

                " Metastable state: The excited state, which has a long life time, is known as metastable state. Optical pumping: This process is required to achieve population inversion and used in Ruby laser. Pumping process is defined as: “The process which excites the atoms from ground state to excited state to achieve population inversion”. Population Inversion: Generally, number of atoms in the ground state is greater than the number of atoms in higher energy states. But in order to produce a laser beam, the minimum requirement is stimulated emission. Stimulated emission takes place only if the number of atoms in the higher energy level is greater than the number of atoms in the lower energy level. Simply population inversion is nothing but number of atoms in higher energy level is greater than the number of atom in lower energy level.Spontaneous Emission: When an atom in the excited state emits a photon of energy ‘hv’ coming down to ground state by itself without any external agency, such an emission is called spontaneous emission. Atom*  atom + hv. Photons released in spontaneous emission are not coherent. Hence spontaneous emission is not useful for producing lasers. Stimulated Emission: When an atom in the excited state, emits two photons of same energy ‘hv’ while coming to down to ground state with the influence of an external agency, such an emission is called stimulated emission. Atom*  atom + 2hv.In the two photons one photon induces the stimulated emission and the second one is released by the transition of atom from higher energy level to lower energy level. Both the photons are strictly coherent. Hence stimulated emission is responsible for laser production.Optical fibers are the waveguides through which electromagnetic waves of optical frequency range can be guided through them to travel long distances.An optical fiber works on the principle of total internal reflection (TIR).Total Internal Reflection: when a ray of light travels from a denser medium into a rarer medium and if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle then the light gets totally reflected into the denser medium.Acceptance Angle: All right rays falling on optical fiber are not transmitted through the fiber. Only those light rays making i > c at the core-cladding interface are transmitted through the fiber by undergoing TIR. For which angle of incidence, the refraction angle is greater than 900 will be propagated through TIR. There by Acceptance Angle is defined as: The maximum angle of incidence to the axis of optical fiber at which the light ray may enter the fiber so that it can be propagated through TIR.An optical fiber consists of three (3) co-axial regions.  The inner most region is the light-guiding region known as “Core”. It is surrounded by a middle co-axial regional known as “cladding”. The outer most regions which completely covers the core & cladding regions is called “sheath or buffer jacket”.  Sheath protects the core & cladding regions from external contaminations, in addition to providing mechanical strength to the fiber.  The refractive index of core (n1) is always greater than the refractive index of cladding (n2) i.e., n1 > n2 to observe the light propagation structure of optical fiber.`",

                "Electrical Conduction: The substances are divided into 4 types depending upon their capability of flow of electrons. i) Conductors: The Substances which allows electricity to pass through them are called conductors. Ex :- Metals, metal sulphides, acids, alkalis, salt sol. and fused salts The electrical conductors are of two types. 1. Metallic or Electronic conductors. 2. Electrolytic conductors ii) Non-conductors: The substances which do not allow electricity are called non-conductors. Ex: Pure water, dry wood, rubber, paper, non-metals etc. iii) Semi conductors: The substances which partially conduct electricity are called semiconductors. The conducting properties of semi-conducting properties are increased by the addition of certain impurities called “dopping”. Ex: ‘si’ and addition of V group elements like ‘p’ ‘si’ produces n-type semi-conductor. On addition of iii group element like ‘B’, Al, ‘si’ produces p-type of semi-conductor.Ohm found that the solution of electrolyte also offers resistance to flow of current in the solution. “The resistance (R) of a conductor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area (a)” R α R α a R α R= ρ → ρ - Specific resistance. If cm and a= 1cm2 then R = ρ then the specific resistance is defined as “The resistance offered by a material of unit length and unit area of cross section is called specific resistance” ρ = R/ /a = R×a/ Units: ohm × cm2 /cm = ohm cm Conductance: The reciprocal of resistance is called Conductance L = Units: ohm -1 (or) mho (C.G.S) Siemens (S) (M.K.S) Specific Conductance (or) Conductivity: Reciprocal of specific resistance is known as specific conductance. 1/R = 1/ρ ×1/ L= k.a/l K = L/a/l = L× l/a If l = 1cm, a =1 cm2 then K = L, then the specific conductance is defined as. 7 “The conductance of a solution enclosed between two parallel electrodes of unit area of cross – section separated by unit distance”.Measurement of Conductance of Electrolyte:The measurement of Conductance (L) of an electrolyte solution involves the estimation ofresistance (R) of the electrolytic solution. This is usually done by ‘wheat stone bridge circuit’which involves a comparison of unknown resistance with standard resistance.",

                "Corrosion The surface of almost all the metals begin to decay more or less rapidly when exposed to atmospheric gases, water or other reactive liquid medium. The process of decay metal by environmental attack is known as corrosion. Metals undergo corrosion and convert to their oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphides etc. E.g. Iron undergoes corrosion to form reddish brown colour rust [Fe2O3. 3H2O]. Copper undergoes corrosion to form a green film of basic carbonate [CuCO3 + Cu (OH) 2].Oxidation Corrosion: This is carried out by the direct action of oxygen low or high Temperatures on metals in absence of moisture. Alkali metals and Alkaline earth metals are rapidly oxidized at low temperatures. At high temperature all metals are oxidized (except Ag, Au, and Pt). M ----- M 2+ + 2e- (Oxidation) O2 + 2e- ----2O2- (Reduction) M + O2 -----M 2+ + 2O2- (Metal oxide).Mechanism: Initially the surface of metal undergoes oxidation and the resulting metal oxide scale forms a barrier which restricts further oxidation. The extent of corrosion depends upon the nature of metal oxide.Liquid metal corrosion: This corrosion is due to chemical action of flowing liquid metal at high temperatures on solid metal or alloy. The corrosion reaction involves either dissolution of a solid metal by a liquid metal or internal penetration of the liquid metal into the solid metal.This type of Corrosion occurs where a conducting liquid is in contact with the metal. This corrosion occurs due to the existence of separate anodic and cathodic parts, between which current flows through the conducting solution.  At anodic area, oxidation reaction occurs there by destroying the anodic metal either by dissolution or formation of compounds. Hence corrosion always occurs at anodic parts.Absorption of oxygen: For example, rusting of iron in neutral aqueous solution of electrolytes in presence of atmospheric oxygen. Usually the surface of iron is coated with a thin film of iron oxide. If the film develops cracks, anodic areas are created on the surface. While the metal parts act as cathodes. It shows that anodes are small areas, while the rest metallic part forms large.Waterline corrosion or Concentration cell corrosion This type of corrosion occurs due to electrochemical attack of the metal surface exposed to electrolyte of varying concentrations or varying aeration.",

                "The pure water is composed of two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen by volume and dissolves many substances. These dissolved salts are the impurities in water. Water is a very good solvent. So it is called as universal solvent.Permanent Hardness:- Permanent hardness cannot be removed by boiling . It is due to CaCl2, CaSO4, MgCl2, MgSO4 and nitrates in H2O. These salts cannot remove this hardness. Fe3+, Al3+ & Mn2+ also cause hardness in water.EDTA method:- In EDTA methods, the known water sample is titrated against standard EDTA solution using EBT as indicator in the presence of basic buffer solution(PH=10). At the end point the wine red color changes to blue. Principle:- The ca 2+ &Mg2+ ions present in water are responsible for hardness. These icons form selectable complexes with the indicator (EBT) and these metal icons forms stable complexes with EDTA. This fact is used to estimate the hardness of water sample. The metal ions ca 2+ & Mg2+ react with the EBT indicator and forms a stable complex at PH-10.Whenever we are adding EDTA solution to the wine- red color (M-In) solution, the metal ions form more stable complex with EDTA. When all the metal ions in the sample complexed with EDTA, further addition of EDTA liberates the free indicator solution at PH-10 which in blue color indicates the end point of the titration.Determination of Hardness of Water by Winkler’s method: The determination of dissolved oxygen is to bring about the oxidization of potassium iodide with the dissolved oxygen present in the water sample after adding MnSO4, KOH and KI. The basic manganic oxide formed acts as an oxygen carrier to enable the dissolved oxygen in the molecular form to take part in the reaction. The liberated iodine is titrated against standard hypo Solution using starch indicator.Foaming: - Formation of stable bubbles at the surface of water in the boiler is calling foaming. More foaming will cause more priming. It results with the formation of wet steam that harms the boiler cylinder and turbine blades. Foaming is due to the presence of oil drops, grease and some suspended solids.Scale &sludge formation:- The water in boiler is continuously heated causes the increase in the concentration of dissolved and suspended solids. These are precipitated and slowly precipitate on the inner walls of the boiler plate. This precipitation takes place in two ways.Zeolite (or) permutit process:- Zeolite is a three-dimensional silicate. The chemical formula of zeolite is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate represented as Na2 OAl2 O3.xH2O yH2O (x=2 to 10 &y=z-6). Zeolites are capable exchanging ions with sodium ions. So it is capable of exchanging hardness producing icons present in water. This process also called as permutit process. Zeolite can be written as Na2Ze The two Na+ icons is replaced by one Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ ions.",

Polymers can be defined as the large molecules (macro molecular) formed by the linkage of small molecules called monomers. (In Greek language poly means many & mer means units).Compounding of plastics:- Compounding of plastics may be defined as the mixing of different materials like plasticizers, fillers of extenders, lubricants, pigments to the thermoplastic & thermosetting resins to increase their useful properties like strength, toughness, etc. Resins have plasticity or binding property, but need other ingredients to be mixed with them for fabrication into useful shapes. Ingredients used in compounding o plastics are (1)Resins (2) Plasticizers (3) fillers (4) pigments (5) Stabilizers.Teflon is also known as Fluon. Due to the presence of highly electronegative fluorine atoms. There are strong attractive force is responsible for high toughness & high chemical resistance towards all chemicals except hot alkali metal & hot fluorine. Uses:-It is used in making seals & gaskets, which have to withstand high temperature. It is also used for insulation of electrical items and for making non-sticky surface coating, particularly for cooking utensils. Teflon used as insulating material for motors, transformers, cables, wires, fitting etc.Bakelite (or) phenol formaldehyde Resin:- The condensation reaction of phenol & formaldehyde in the presence of acid or alkali catalyst and at proper temperature produces the phenol formaldehyde resin or Bakelite resin.The structures of nylons are linear that permits side by side alignment. Moreover, the molecular chains are held together by hydrogen bonds. Thus, nylons have high crystalline which imparts high strength, high melting point, elasticity, toughness, abrasion resistance and retention of good mechanical properties up to 1250C. They are polar polymers, they have good hydrocarbon resistance.",

                "FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES Introduction: We know that ݕ݂ = ሺݔሻ is a function where ‘ݕ ‘is dependent variable and ‘ݔ ‘is independent variable. We are going to expand the idea of functions to include functions for more than one independent variable. In day to day life we deal with things which depend on two or more quantity. For example, the area of the room which is a rectangle consists of two variables: length(say a) and breadth (say b) is given by ܣ .ܾܽ = Similarly the volume of the rectangular parallelepiped consists of three variables a, b, c i.e., length, breadth, height is given by V = a b c. In this chapter we say that z is a function of two variables x , y and write ݖ݂ = ሺݔ , ݕሻ where ‘ݖ ‘is dependent variable and ‘ݔǯ & Ǯݕǯ are independent variables. Limit of a function of two variables: A function f(x, y) is said to tend to the limit l as (x, y) tends to (a,b) i.e., x→ ܽ ܽ݊݀ ݕ ܾ → if corresponding to any given positive number ∈ ∃ a positive number 𝛿 ݑݏܿℎ ݐℎܽݐ݂| ሺݔ ,ݕሻ − ݈| <∈ for all points (x,y) whenever |ݔ| ,�� ൑ |ܽ − ݕ .�� ൑ |ܾ − In other words the variable value (x ,y) approaches a finite fixed value l when the variable value (x, y) approaches a fixed value (a, b) i.e., lim௫→௔ ௬→௕ lim ݎ݋ ݈ = ሻݕ ,ݔሺ݂ ሺ௫,௬ሻ→ሺ௔,௕ሻ ݈ = ሻݕ ,ݔሺ݂ Continuity of a function of two variables at a point: A function f(x,y) is continuous at a point (a, b) if, corresponding to any given positive number ∈ ∃ a positive number 𝛿 ݑݏܿℎ ݐℎܽݐ݂| ሺݔ ,ݕሻ − ݂ሺܽ, ܾሻ| <∈ for all points (x,y) whenever 0< (x-a)2+(y-b)2<𝛿 ଶ Note: Every differentiable function is always continuous, but converse need not be true. Solved Problems: 1. Evaluate lim ௫→ଵ ௬→ଶ ଶ௫మ௬ ௫ మ+௬మ+ଵ Sol. lim ௫→ଵ ௬→ଶ ଶ௫మ௬ ௫ మ+௬మ+ଵ = lim ௫→ଵ {lim௬→ଶ [ ଶ௫మ௬ ௫ మ+௬మ+ଵ]} = lim ௫→ଵ ସ௫మ ௫ మ+ହ = ସ ଺ = ଶ ଷ (or) lim ௫→ଵ ௬→ଶ ଶ௫మ௬ ௫ మ+௬మ+ଵ = lim ௬→ଶ {lim௫→ଵ [ ଶ௫మ௬ ௫ మ+௬మ+ଵ]} = lim ௫→ଵ ଶ௬ ௬మ+ଶ = ସ ଺ = ଶ ଷ 2. If f(x ,y) = ௫−௬ ଶ௫+௬ show that lim ௫→଴ {lim ௬→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,ݕሻ} ≠ lim ௬→଴ {lim ௫→଴ {ሻݕ ,ݔሺ݂ Sol. lim ௫→଴ {lim௬→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,ݕሻ} = lim ௫→଴ {lim௬→଴ ௫−௬ ଶ௫+௬} = lim ௫→଴ ௫ ଶ௫ = ଵ ଶ lim ௬→଴ {lim௫→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,ݕሻ} = lim ௫→଴ {lim௬→଴ ௫−௬ ଶ௫+௬} = lim ௬→଴ −௬ ௬ = -1 Hence the result follows. 3. Discuss the continuity of the function f(x,y) = { ଶ௫௬ ௫ మ+௬మ , ሺݔ ,ݕሻ ≠ ሺͲ,Ͳሻ Ͳ, ሺݔ ,ݕሻ = ሺͲ,Ͳሻ Sol. Let us consider the limit of the function for testing the continuity along the line y = mx. Now lim௫→௢ ௬→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,ݕሻ = lim௫→௢ ௬→௢ ଶ௫௬ ௫ మ+௬మ = lim ௫→଴ ଶ௠௫మ ௫ మ+௠మ௫ మ = ଶ௠ ଵ+௠మ Which is different for the different m selected. ∴ lim௫→௢ ௬→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,ݕሻ does not exist. Consider lim ௫→଴ ݂ሺݔ ,Ͳሻ = lim ௫→଴ ଶ௫ሺ଴ሻ ௫ మ+଴ =lim ௫→଴ Ͳ = Ͳ = ݂ሺͲ,Ͳሻ lim ௬→଴ ݂ሺݕ ,Ͳሻ = lim ௬→଴ ଶ௬ሺ଴ሻ ௬మ+଴ =lim ௬→଴ Ͳ = Ͳ = ݂ሺͲ,Ͳሻ ∴ f(x,y) is continuous for given values of x and y but it is not continuous at (0,0) Partial Differentiation: Let z = fሺx, yሻ be a function of two variables x and y. Then lim ௫→଴ ௙ሺ௫+∆௫,௬ሻ−௙ሺ௫,௬ሻ ∆௫ , if it exists , is said to be partial derivative or partial differential coefficient of z or f(x,y) , w.r.t.x . It is denoted by the symbol డ௭ డ௫ or డ௙ డ௫ or ݂௫ . i.e, for the partial derivative of ݖ݂ = ሺݔ ,ݕሻ w.r.t. ‘x’ , ‘y’ is kept constant. Similarly, the partial derivative of ݖ݂ = ሺݔ ,ݕሻ w.r.t. ‘y’ , ‘x’ is kept constant and is defined as lim ୷→଴ ୤ሺ୶,୷+∆୷ሻ−୤ሺ୶,୷ሻ ∆୷ and is denoted by డ௭ డ௬ or డ௙ డ௬ or ݂௬. Higher order Partial Derivatives:In general the first order partial derivatives డ௙ డ௫ and డ௙ డ௬ are also functions of x and y and they can be differentiated repeatedly to get higher order partial derivatives, So ∂ ∂୶ ቀ ∂୤ ∂୶ ቁ = ∂ మ ୤ ∂୶మ , ∂ ∂୷ ቀ ∂୤ ∂୷ ቁ = ∂ మ ୤ ∂୷మ , ∂ ∂୶ ቀ ∂୤ ∂୷ ቁ = ∂ మ ୤ ∂୶ ∂୷ , ∂ ∂୷ ቀ ∂୤ ∂୶ ቁ = ∂ మ ୤ ∂୷ ∂୶ , ∂ ∂୶ ቀ ∂ మ ୤ ∂୶మ ቁ = ∂ య ୤ ∂୶య , ∂ ∂୷ ቀ ∂ మ ୤ ∂୷మ ቁ = ∂ య ୤ ∂୷య , ∂ ∂୶ ቀ ∂ మ ୤ ∂୷మ ቁ = ∂ య ୤ ∂୶ ∂୷మ , and so on. The chain rule of Partial Differentiation: Let ݖ݂ = ሺݑ ,ݒሻ where u = ∅ሺx, yሻ and v = g(x,y) . Then ∂୸ ∂୶ = ∂୸ ∂୳ ∂୳ ∂୶ + ∂୸ ∂୴ ∂୴ ∂୶ and ∂୸ ∂୷ = ∂୸ ∂୳ ∂୳ ∂୷ + ∂୸ ∂୴ ∂୴ ∂୷ Total differential coefficient: Let z = fሺx, yሻ where x = ∅ሺtሻ and y = g(t) Substituting x and y in z = f(x,y) , z becomes a function of a single variable t. Then the derivative of z w.r.t. ‘t’ i.e, డ௭ డ௧ is called the total differential coefficient or total derivative of z. ∴ ∂୸ ∂୲ = ∂୸ ∂୶ ∂୶ ∂୲ + ∂୸ ∂୷ ∂୷ ∂୲ Note: In the differential form , this result can be written as ݀ݑ୳∂ = ∂୶ . dx + ∂୳ ∂୷ . dy Here, du is called the total differential of u.
